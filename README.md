# Desktopify - Site Specific Browsers

## What is Desktopify?
Desktopify allows you to view individual websites in their own dedicated browser window. This is perfect for reducing tabs in your browser and giving specific websites, such as an email client or web app, their own shortcut on your taskbar, desktop or start menu.

Desktopify helps you reduce browser clutter and gives you easy access to the websites you use the most.

Desktopify is built on CEFPython, which uses Chromium to display websites, for complete website compatibility. It was inspired by Ice and Peppermint OS which provide similar functionality on Linux.

Desktopify is only available for Windows OS.

## How to use Desktopify
Download the most current stable release from the releases section. Unzip the folder and run the Desktopify.exe. 

The first time you run the program it may take a minute to load, this is due to the initial setup process. Data is stored in your local APPDATA.

## Why use Desktopify?
Desktopify was created to provide convenient access to websites and web apps and declutter your browser. Desktopify creates links to specific websites on your desktop and start menu, you can even pin them to your taskbar!

Desktopify also provides an easy to use interface for creating new SSBs, removing old SSBs and launching SSBs.

## What is an SSB (Site Specific Browser)?
